The purpose of this exercise is to gain experience using CSS3 variables. These are different from Sass-style variables; Sass variables are defined in the Sass file, but once compiled to CSS the values cannot be updated. CSS3 variables can have their values updated through the use of JavaScript. The input HTML elements have a name property that corresponds with the CSS properties we want to update. We can create CSS3 variable references and attach them to the root element, provide them with some default values, and utilize JavaScript to attach event listeners to the input HTML elements that will call upon an event handler function whenever the input values have been changed by the user. We will define the function to target the entire document and update the values of the CSS variables from there.
