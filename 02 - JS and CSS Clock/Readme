  Linear Gradient - Diagonal

  You can make a gradient diagonally by specifying both the horizontal and vertical starting positions.

  Using Angles
If you want more control over the direction of the gradient, you can define an angle, instead of the predefined directions (to bottom, to top, to right, to left, to bottom right, etc.).

Syntax
background-image: linear-gradient(angle, color-stop1, color-stop2);

background-image: linear-gradient(-90deg, red, yellow);
